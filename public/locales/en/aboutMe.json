    "description": "As a frontend developer, I have spent the past two years designing user-friendly UI and UX, thoroughly enjoying the process of web development.\nHowever, while working on projects, I realized the importance of backend development during API communication and data modeling processes,\nand I decided to become a full-stack developer to build more efficient and stable services.\n\nTo achieve this, I focused on learning backend technologies centered around Java,\ngaining practical skills in RESTful API design, database management, and server logic implementation.\nThrough this process, I have realized that the seamless integration of frontend and backend significantly enhances the completeness of a service.\n\nMoving forward, as a full-stack developer, I aim to provide more complete and polished services\nby combining UI/UX design with stable server logic, and to become an indispensable developer for my team."
